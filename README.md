<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life</p>

<a href='https://practicalcoder.com/life.html'>~2000 when javascript was vanilla and DHTML was exciting.</a>

<a href='https://practicalcoder.com/react-life/'>... ~up to date: UI component based, transpiled, bundled.</a>

<p>This algorithm provides a neat way to test UI capabilities.  The grid size can be increased and the step duration adjusted to see how much oonph your device has.  Each cell has a touch listner and it's fun to interact with the stable states that evolve. </p>

<p>The react version was developed in Firefox and Chrome, Safari compatibilty is an issue right now and it's not a priority. If anyone would like to update me on what the javascript error code is when using Safari please do .... otherwise use Firefox or Chrome instead.</p>
